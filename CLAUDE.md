## 🍽 CORE MISSION (READ THIS FIRST)

**DishDash is a smart ordering system that learns customer behavior and makes ordering faster, easier, and more personalized every time.**

### Core Value Proposition

- Reduce time to order
- Increase repeat orders
- Increase cart value
- Learn user behavior continuously

### Product Identity

DishDash IS:
- ✅ An ordering system (not a generic website)
- ✅ Behavior-driven (every feature tracks data)
- ✅ AI-powered (subtle, invisible to users)
- ✅ A white-label SaaS platform — each restaurant feels like they own the system

DishDash is NOT:
- ❌ A basic WooCommerce storefront
- ❌ A visible "AI system" (users should feel fast/easy/natural, not "AI")
- ❌ A clone of Uber Eats or Glovo
- ❌ A generic WordPress admin — the backend must feel like a premium SaaS product

### Development Principles (STRICT)

1. **Every feature must answer:** "How does this help understand user behavior?"
2. **No feature without tracking.** Every user action must be recorded.
3. **AI is invisible.** Users feel fast, easy, natural — never "AI system."
4. **Mobile-first always.** Africa is mobile, not desktop.
5. **Keep architecture clean.** Follow the modular system. No shortcuts.
6. **Speed is addictive.** Optimize everything for performance. Fast = repeat usage.

### Architecture Flow
```
User
↓
UI (DishDash frontend)
↓
🧠 AI Layer (behavior tracking + rules engine)
↓
Cart
↓
WooCommerce (payment processing)
```

## 🗄️ Schema Changes — IMPORTANT

There is **one** installer file: `install.php` at the repo root. All `CREATE TABLE` definitions live there. `dishdash-core/class-dd-install.php` was deleted in v3.4.97 — it had been deprecated since v3.4.92 (renamed `DD_Install` → `DD_Schema_Upgrader`, no live schema declarations). The canonical installer is `install.php` exclusively.

### How to add a new table or column

1. Edit `install.php` — add the column to the `CREATE TABLE` block or append a new `CREATE TABLE` block inside `create_tables()`
2. Bump `DD_VERSION` in `dish-dash.php` (both the header comment and the constant)
3. Commit, tag, release as usual

**No WP-CLI step needed.** The auto-migration guard in `dish-dash.php` runs `dbDelta()` on the next admin page load after a version mismatch is detected, and updates `dd_db_version` to match.

### What auto-migration can and can't do

- ✅ Add new tables
- ✅ Add new columns to existing tables
- ✅ Add new indexes
- ❌ Drop columns (dbDelta limitation — never drops anything)
- ❌ Change column types in destructive ways (dbDelta is conservative)
- ❌ Rename columns (must be a manual ALTER TABLE via WP-CLI)

For drops/renames, use a manual migration step and document it in the release notes.

## 🎨 Brand Colors

Brand colors are **always dynamic** — set by each restaurant in Dish Dash → Brand
Identity and stored in wp_options. All code must read colors from wp_options or
CSS variables. **Never hardcode hex values anywhere in the codebase.**

| Option Key | Description |
|---|---|
| `dish_dash_primary_color` | Header, buttons, active states, CTAs |
| `dish_dash_dark_color` | Secondary elements, text accents |
| `dish_dash_background_color` | Page background |
| `dish_dash_font` | Typography (Inter default) |

**Admin CSS variables (set on `<body>` by PHP in every admin page):**
```css
--dd-brand:       [restaurant primary color];
--dd-brand-rgb:   [R,G,B components for rgba() usage];
--dd-brand-light: [10% opacity version];
--dd-brand-dark:  [darkened 15%];
```

**Rule:** Khana Khazana uses `#65040d` as primary — this is one restaurant's
config, not a hardcoded value. What you see in the mockup is a placeholder.
Always read from `get_option('dish_dash_primary_color')` in PHP.

## 🔄 Workflow — How We Work

### Roles

| Role | Responsibilities |
|---|---|
| **Claude** (claude.ai) | Planning, architecture, investigation briefs, fix briefs, release notes |
| **Claude Code** (CLI terminal) | Executes file edits based on briefs — never infers tasks, never acts without a brief |
| **Developer** (human) | GitHub releases, deployment, testing, feedback |

### The Loop

```
Claude writes Investigation Brief
↓
Claude Code investigates → reports findings (NO edits yet)
↓
Developer pastes findings to Claude
↓
Claude reviews → writes Fix Brief
↓
Claude Code edits files → reports complete
↓
Developer pastes report to Claude
↓
Claude gives release instructions (tag, title, description)
↓
Developer commits → creates GitHub release → deploys → tests
↓
Developer reports result with screenshot → Claude writes next brief
↓
Repeat
```

### Claude Code Session Setup

Every Claude Code session MUST start with:
> Read `CLAUDE.md` from the repo root at github.com/frisoftltd/dish-dash
> before doing any work. This file contains the full project context,
> rules, architecture, and current state.

### Release Process

1. All files committed to `main` branch (lowercase — **NEVER `Main`**)
2. Version bumped in `dish-dash.php` in **BOTH** locations:
   - `* Version: X.X.X` in the plugin header comment
   - `define('DD_VERSION', 'X.X.X');` constant
3. **CLAUDE.md updated in the same commit** — `Last updated` line + Current State table
4. Developer creates GitHub release with tag `vX.X.X` (**WITH the `v` prefix** — without it, Actions will not build the zip)
5. GitHub Actions builds `dish-dash.zip` automatically (~30 seconds)
6. Deploy via ONE of:

**Method A — cPanel Terminal:**
```bash
cd /tmp && wget https://github.com/frisoftltd/dish-dash/releases/latest/download/dish-dash.zip && unzip -o dish-dash.zip -d /tmp/dd-update && cp -r /tmp/dd-update/dish-dash/* /home/imitjsiy/dishdash.khanakhazana.rw/wp-content/plugins/dish-dash/ && rm -rf /tmp/dd-update /tmp/dish-dash.zip && echo "Done!"
```

**Method B — WordPress auto-update:**
WP Admin → Plugins → Check for Updates → Update Now

7. Purge LiteSpeed Cache: WP Admin → LiteSpeed Cache → Toolbox → Purge All
8. Test in incognito window
9. Verify: `grep "DD_VERSION" /home/imitjsiy/dishdash.khanakhazana.rw/wp-content/plugins/dish-dash/dish-dash.php`

---

## 🚨 Rules — NEVER Break These

### Claude Code Operating Rules

**Rule 0 — Version bump + CLAUDE.md update is mandatory on every release.**
Every brief that ships code MUST end with:
- Bump `* Version: X.X.X` in dish-dash.php header
- Bump `define( 'DD_VERSION', 'X.X.X' );` in dish-dash.php
- Update `Last updated` line and Current State table in CLAUDE.md
- `git add [all changed files] dish-dash.php CLAUDE.md`
- `git commit -m "release: vX.X.X — [description]"`
- `git push origin HEAD:main`

Never commit changed files without dish-dash.php and CLAUDE.md.
Never push without the version bumped and CLAUDE.md updated.

**Rule 1a — Scope is a hard wall, not a guideline.**
If a brief says "fix X in file Y", touch ONLY file Y, ONLY the lines
that fix X. If you notice another bug while reading the file — REPORT IT.
Do not fix it. Do not "clean it up". Do not refactor "while you're in there".
Write it in your report and wait for a new brief.

**Rule 1b — Never touch a file not listed in the brief.**
If fixing X requires understanding file Z, you may READ file Z.
You may NOT edit file Z unless it is explicitly listed.
If you believe file Z also needs changing, REPORT IT and stop.
Wait for explicit instruction before touching it.

**Rule 2 — Always start in Plan Mode.**
`claude --permission-mode plan`
Analyze first, never edit without approval.

**Rule 3 — Never infer a task.**
Wait for a brief. Never assume what comes next.

**Rule 4 — NEVER run git add, commit, or push without explicit instruction from the developer.**

**Rule 5 — Use @mentions for exact files.**
Never read the whole codebase. Target only the files you need.

**Rule 6 — Run /compact between tasks.**

**Rule 7 — Be concise in reports.**
Root cause, files changed, test steps only.

### Code Rules

- **Always provide complete files** — never partial snippets
- **Always include exact GitHub path** for every file
- **Always state CREATE new or EDIT existing** for each file
- **Never change code outside the scope of the current task** — scope creep causes regressions
- **Always check current file state before editing** — read the file first
- **Investigation findings BEFORE writing code** — always diagnose, then fix
- **Always check inline styles in PHP templates before CSS files** — past bugs caused by inline styles, not CSS
- **Verify which template renders a given URL before editing** — wrong file = wasted release
- **Push to `main` (lowercase)** — NEVER `Main` (capital M creates orphan branch)
- **Do NOT create release tags** — developer does that via GitHub UI

### Architecture Rules

Each module MUST be completely independent:
- Own folder: `modules/feature/`
- Own class: `class-dd-feature-module.php`
- Extends `DD_Module` base class
- Registers its own admin submenu independently
- Communicates with other modules ONLY via `do_action()` and `apply_filters()`
- NEVER directly calls another module's methods
- NEVER writes to another module's database table
- Template module uses `DD_PLUGIN_DIR` constant (not `plugin_dir_path(__FILE__)`)

### Data Access Rules

- **All NEW code** must use `DD_API::` for data access — no direct `wc_get_product()` or raw `$wpdb` calls in new features
- Existing code keeps working as-is — migrate gradually when files are touched
- `DD_API` returns normalized arrays, NOT WC_Product objects
- `DD_API` has built-in transient caching (5-min TTL, auto-invalidated on product save)

### DB Rules

- `dbDelta()` for all DB table creation — exclusively
- `dbDelta()` does NOT run on zip updates — any release adding new tables must manually call `DD_Install::create_tables()` via WP-CLI immediately after deploy

### Admin UI Rules (Phase 5 — enforced from v3.4.20 onward)

- No WP grey or WP blue (`#2271b1`) anywhere on any Dish Dash admin page
- No hardcoded hex colors — all colors from `var(--dd-brand)` CSS variable
- Restaurant logo must show in sidebar
- Inter font loaded on all admin pages
- `--dd-brand` and `--dd-brand-rgb` output on `:root` in `get_admin_styles()`
- Cards: 12px border-radius, `box-shadow: 0 1px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)`, padding 24px

### Tracking Rules

- No feature without tracking — every user action must be recorded
- New tracking events MUST be added to `modules/tracking/event-schemas.php` FIRST
- `meta` JSON field contains ONLY metadata — dedicated DB columns are NOT listed in schema
- Validation mode: `warn` — events logged but not rejected

## 🖥 Phase 5 — Backend Dashboard & Admin Transformation

### Vision

The WordPress admin is completely transformed into a professional SaaS product.
Each restaurant feels like they own the system — not a generic WordPress install.
Structure is universal. Colors, logo, fonts come from Brand Identity settings.

**What must NEVER appear in the admin:**
- WordPress logo anywhere
- WordPress blue (`#2271b1`) or default WP grey
- Plugin update badges or notification banners (except the Updates page)
- Any hint this is built on WordPress

## 🧠 Key Lessons Learned (Hard-Won)

| Lesson | Context |
|---|---|
| Always check inline styles in PHP templates before CSS files | 800px width was an inline style in `grid.php` — caused 4 wrong fixes |
| `page-dishdash.php` is the HOMEPAGE template, not the menu page | Shortcode in `grid.php` renders `/restaurant-menu/` |
| `dish-dash-theme` is the active theme, NOT Astra | Only `dish-dash-theme` exists on server |
| `display: flex !important` overrides HTML `hidden` attribute | Use `.dd-cat-row:not([hidden])` instead |
| Unchecked HTML checkboxes don't submit in forms | Must use `isset($_POST[$key]) ? '1' : '0'` |
| LiteSpeed Cache masks frontend changes | Always purge explicitly when debugging UI |
| `git push origin Main` creates an orphan branch | Always lowercase `main` |
| Functions inside containing functions cause JS scope conflicts | Extract into independent modules |
| `dbDelta()` does not run on zip updates | New DB tables need manual `DD_Install::create_tables()` via WP-CLI post-deploy |
| `remove_all_actions('admin_notices')` suppresses all plugin banners | Exception: check `get_current_screen()->id === 'update-core'` first |
| Dashboard content width was capped — right side dead zone | Check for `max-width` in admin.css AND inline styles in dashboard.php |
| Google Reviews `(array) $r` deep-cast bug | Only converts outer level — fix requires recursive `dd_to_array()` |
| WhatsApp notifications use `window.location.href` not `window.open` | Avoids mobile browser popup blocking |
| `woocommerce_payment_complete` hook wired to `DD_Notifications` | Any future gateway fires notifications automatically |
| OPcache/auto-update race condition causes fatal errors | Mitigated with `class_exists` guard + `opcache_reset()` on `upgrader_process_complete` |

## 🚀 Multi-Tenant Deploy Checklist

Run before handing any site to a restaurant:

1. AJAX smoke test:
```bash
curl -s -X POST https://[site]/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php \
  -d "action=dd_cart_get" | grep -q "success" \
  && echo "AJAX ✅" || echo "AJAX ❌ BROKEN"
```
2. Confirm response is not 404
3. Set up UptimeRobot monitor on `https://[site]/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`
   — POST method, 5-min interval, SMS + email alert on failure
4. Only hand site to restaurant after both checks pass
